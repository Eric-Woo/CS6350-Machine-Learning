Q2: I implement SVM in the primal domain in SVM_Primal_Domain.ipynb file. I use the schedule_type=0, or 1 to represent the two different schedule of learning rate.
Q3(a): You can run the SVM_Dual.ipynb to check the dual SVM learning algorithm.
Q3(b,c): You can run the SVM_Kernel.ipynb by using the Gaussian kernel
Q3(d): You can run the Perceptron_Kernel.ipynb by using the Gaussian Kernel.
