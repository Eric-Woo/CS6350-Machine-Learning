How to use this code to learn decision tree



In both the 'Car' and the 'Bank' code, to build the decision tree, the function "clssifier = DecisionTree(gain_type, depth)" in which gain _type are choices of gini_index, entropy, and majority error, depth you should give it a depth number.I splitted the the training and test into two parts. You can use get the error results through the error function by passing the predictions compared with true label.
